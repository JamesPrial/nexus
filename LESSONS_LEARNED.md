# Lessons Learned from Nexus Development

## Phase 3 Implementation Insights

### 1. Test Coverage Reality vs. Goals
**Lesson**: Set realistic test coverage goals. We achieved 73% instead of the targeted 100%.

**Why**: Some code paths are extremely difficult to test without complex mocking:
- JSON encoding errors in HTTP handlers
- Shutdown error scenarios
- Race conditions in concurrent code

**Recommendation**: Aim for 80% coverage with focus on critical paths. Use integration tests to supplement unit tests.

### 2. Metrics System Initialization
**Issue**: The metrics collector can be nil even when metrics are enabled in configuration.

**Root Cause**: The initialization order in the container doesn't guarantee the metrics collector is created when metrics are enabled.

**Future Fix**: 
```go
// Ensure collector exists when metrics enabled
if config.Metrics.Enabled && container.MetricsCollector() == nil {
    // Force initialization or error
}
```

### 3. Integration Tests Are Crucial
**Lesson**: Unit tests alone don't provide confidence in the full system behavior.

**What Worked**:
- Full middleware chain testing in `tests/integration/full_flow_test.go`
- Testing actual HTTP requests through the entire stack
- Validating rate limiting behavior under load

**Recommendation**: Always include integration tests for:
- Complete request flow
- Error scenarios
- Performance characteristics

### 4. Golangci-lint Location
**Issue**: golangci-lint is not in PATH, located at `/tmp/golangci-lint`

**Solution**: Update Makefile and documentation to use the correct path:
```makefile
GOLANGCI_LINT := $(shell which golangci-lint || echo "/tmp/golangci-lint")
```

### 5. Health Endpoint Implementation
**Decision**: Added health endpoint to the gateway service rather than main.go

**Why**: 
- Better encapsulation
- Easier to test
- Consistent with service boundaries

**Pattern**:
```go
mux.HandleFunc("/health", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(map[string]string{
        "status": "healthy",
        "version": "1.0.0",
    })
})
```

### 6. Graceful Shutdown Complexity
**Lesson**: Go's `http.Server.Shutdown()` handles connection draining well.

**What We Added**:
- Metrics flush before shutdown
- Proper context timeout (30 seconds)
- Error logging for shutdown failures

**Note**: Testing shutdown errors is complex and may not be worth the effort.

### 7. Documentation Should Reflect Reality
**Issue**: Original plans sometimes don't match implementation.

**Example**: Health endpoint location, test coverage goals

**Solution**: Update documentation immediately when implementation differs from plan.

## Architecture Insights

### Dependency Injection Works Well
The container pattern provides excellent testability:
- Easy to mock dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Flexible configuration

### Middleware Order Matters
The chain must be:
1. Validation (catch bad requests early)
2. Authentication (identify client)
3. Rate Limiting (per-client limits)
4. Token Limiting (expensive operation)
5. Proxy (final handler)

### Error Handling Patterns
Always wrap errors with context:
```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to start server: %w", err)
}
```

Never leak sensitive information in errors.

## Testing Strategies That Work

### 1. Table-Driven Tests
```go
testCases := []struct {
    name           string
    input          string
    expectedStatus int
    expectError    bool
}{
    // cases...
}
```

### 2. Mock Servers for External Dependencies
```go
mockUpstream := httptest.NewServer(http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // mock behavior
}))
defer mockUpstream.Close()
```

### 3. Parallel Test Execution
Use `t.Run()` with subtests for better organization and parallel execution.

### 4. Coverage Analysis
```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
grep "0$" coverage.out  # Find uncovered lines
```

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Use sync.RWMutex for Read-Heavy Operations
The rate limiter benefits from RWMutex since reads are more common than writes.

### 2. Goroutine Cleanup
Always use cleanup goroutines for time-based data:
```go
go limiter.StartCleanup(5*time.Minute, stopChan)
```

### 3. Pre-allocate Slices
When size is known, pre-allocate to avoid reallocations.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Skip Error Checks**: Even `defer file.Close()` can fail
2. **Don't Ignore Linter Warnings**: They often catch real bugs
3. **Don't Over-Mock**: Integration tests can be more valuable
4. **Don't Forget Timeouts**: Always set timeouts on HTTP operations
5. **Don't Log Sensitive Data**: Always mask API keys

## Recommended Development Flow

1. Create feature branch
2. Write failing tests first (TDD)
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Refactor for clarity
5. Run linter before commit
6. Update documentation
7. Create detailed PR

## Tools and Commands

```bash
# Most useful commands during development
make test                       # Run all tests
/tmp/golangci-lint run ./...   # Check code quality
go test -v -run TestName       # Run specific test
go test -coverprofile=c.out    # Generate coverage
go tool cover -html=c.out      # View coverage report

# Debugging
go test -race ./...            # Detect race conditions
go test -bench=.               # Run benchmarks
dlv test                       # Debug tests
```

## Future Considerations

1. **OpenTelemetry**: Would provide valuable distributed tracing
2. **Prometheus Native Format**: Better metrics integration
3. **Configuration Hot Reload**: Reduce downtime
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Protect against upstream failures
5. **Request ID Propagation**: Better request tracking

## Key Takeaways

- **Pragmatism Over Perfection**: 73% coverage with good integration tests is better than chasing 100%
- **Test What Matters**: Focus on business logic and integration points
- **Document Reality**: Keep docs in sync with code
- **Clean Architecture Pays Off**: The DI pattern made testing much easier
- **Integration Tests Are Essential**: They catch issues unit tests miss
