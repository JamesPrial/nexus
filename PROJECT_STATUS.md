# Nexus Project Status Summary

## What Is Nexus?
A Go-based API gateway for AI models (OpenAI, etc.) with rate limiting, token counting, and metrics.

## Current State (Phase 3 ‚úÖ Complete)
- Phase 1: ‚úÖ All tests passing, linting fixed, PR #16 merged
- Phase 2: ‚ùì Technical debt cleanup (not yet started)
- Phase 3: ‚úÖ Features implemented, PR #18 created
- Phase 4: üîú Ready to start

### Phase 3 Accomplishments
- Added `/health` endpoint to gateway service
- Enhanced graceful shutdown with metrics flush
- Improved test coverage: 10.7% ‚Üí 73.0%
- Created comprehensive integration tests
- Fixed all golangci-lint issues
- PR #18: https://github.com/JamesPrial/nexus/pull/18

## Remaining Work

### Phase 4: Organization (2-3 hours)
See: `PHASE_4_ORGANIZATION.md`
- Separate overnight-tools repository
- Create v0.1.0 release with Phase 3 features
- Setup GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Finalize documentation
- Add architecture diagrams

## Key Technical Details

**Architecture**: Clean dependency injection with interface-driven design
**Middleware Order**: Validation ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí RateLimit ‚Üí TokenLimit ‚Üí Proxy
**Main Files**: 
- `cmd/gateway/main.go` - Entry point
- `internal/container/container.go` - DI setup
- `internal/interfaces/interfaces.go` - All interfaces
- `internal/gateway/service.go` - Gateway service with health endpoint
- `tests/integration/full_flow_test.go` - Integration tests

**Testing**: 
- Always run `make test` and linting before commits
- Test coverage: 73% for gateway package
- Integration tests validate full middleware chain

**Tooling**:
- golangci-lint location: `/tmp/golangci-lint`
- Use feature branches exclusively

## Quick Health Check
```bash
cd /home/jamesprial/claude/nexus
make test                    # Should pass
/tmp/golangci-lint run ./... # Should have 0 issues
make build                   # Should create ./nexus binary
./nexus                      # Should start on port 8080
curl http://localhost:8080/health  # Should return {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0"}
```

## Lessons Learned (Phase 3)
- Test coverage goals should be realistic (73% vs 100% target)
- Metrics collector initialization needs attention
- Integration tests are crucial for confidence
- Some edge cases require complex mocking
- Documentation should reflect actual implementation

Total estimated time to complete Phase 4: 2-3 hours
