# Enhanced Agents Implementation Summary

## What We've Created

We've successfully integrated insights from the wshobson/agents repository to enhance our TDD-focused agent architecture for the Nexus API Gateway project.

### Key Enhancements

1. **Model-Based Complexity Routing**
   - Haiku: Simple tasks (rapid implementation, basic tests)
   - Sonnet: Standard development (test design, refactoring)
   - Opus: Complex tasks (performance optimization, architecture)

2. **Standardized Agent Format**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: agent-name
   description: When to invoke (with automatic triggers)
   model: haiku|sonnet|opus
   tools: specific tools needed
   tdd_phase: red|green|refactor
   ---
   ```

3. **TDD-Specific Agents**
   - `nexus-test-designer`: Comprehensive test suite creation (RED phase)
   - `nexus-rapid-impl`: Minimal implementation (GREEN phase)
   - `nexus-perf-optimizer`: Performance optimization while keeping tests green
   - Plus supporting agents for debugging, coverage, and review

4. **Automatic Orchestration**
   - File-based triggers (e.g., creating *_test.go files)
   - Context-based triggers (e.g., failing benchmarks)
   - Phase-based triggers (e.g., after tests pass)

5. **Context Management**
   - Structured handoffs between agents
   - Preserved context for long-running projects
   - Minimal, relevant context for each agent

## How to Use

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Create symlink for Claude Code discovery
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s ../agents .claude/agents
```

### 2. Basic Usage
```bash
# Automatic workflow
"Implement rate limiting feature"
# Agents automatically orchestrate: test design → implementation → optimization → refactoring

# Explicit invocation
"Use nexus-test-designer to create comprehensive auth tests"
"Have nexus-perf-optimizer improve the hot path"
```

### 3. TDD Workflow
Always follow RED → GREEN → REFACTOR:
1. Start with nexus-test-designer (RED)
2. Use nexus-rapid-impl (GREEN)
3. Apply optimizations if needed
4. Refactor with specialized agents

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Optimal Resource Usage**: Right model for each task reduces costs
2. **Enforced TDD**: Agents ensure test-first development
3. **Automatic Quality Gates**: Coverage and performance standards enforced
4. **Specialized Expertise**: Deep knowledge in each domain
5. **Efficient Orchestration**: Agents work together seamlessly

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Agent Library**: Add more specialized agents as needed
2. **Refine Triggers**: Improve automatic agent selection
3. **Enhance Context Management**: Better state preservation
4. **Add Metrics**: Track agent effectiveness and usage
5. **Create Templates**: Common multi-agent workflows

The enhanced agent system combines the best of TDD discipline with sophisticated orchestration patterns, creating a powerful development accelerator for the Nexus API Gateway project.
